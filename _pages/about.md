Hi! I'm Disheng Tang, a PhD student at Tsinghua University. My research interests include computational neuroscience and dynamic network. I'm currently under the supervision of Prof. Xiaoxuan Jia. I'm interested in exploring how the dynamic interacting patterns of neurons encode the visual stimulus information.
