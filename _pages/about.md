Hi! I'm Disheng Tang, a PhD student in the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University. My research interests include computational neuroscience and dynamic network. I'm currently under the supervision of Prof. Xiaoxuan Jia.

Education and research background
======
I received both my M.Eng. and B.Eng. from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering at Beihang University. During my master's studies, I focused on the predictability of temporal networks, co-advised by Prof. Wenbo Du (Beihang Univ.) and Prof. Gang Yan (Tongji Univ.). Prior to the PhD program at Tsinghua Univ., I studied in the Quantitative Biosciences PhD program at Georgia Tech remotely for a year until I got a visa issue. I was then co-advised by Prof. Hannah Choi (Gatech), Prof. Xiaoxuan Jia (Tsinghua Univ.), and Prof. Joel Zylberberg (York Univ.) on the project of stimulus-dependent functional network. 

Research interest
======
Currently at Neural Coding Lab led by Prof. Xiaoxuan Jia, I'm generally interested in
* encoding the visual information as dynamic networks of neurons;
* controlling the brain network;
* brain-inspired AI.
