Hi! I'm Disheng Tang, a PhD student in the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University under the supervision of Prof. Xiaoxuan Jia. My research interests lie in computational neuroscience and dynamic networks.

Background
======
I received my B.Eng. and M.Eng. from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering at Beihang University. During my master's studies, I focused on the predictability of temporal networks, co-advised by Prof. Wenbo Du (Beihang Univ.) and Prof. Gang Yan (Tongji Univ.). Prior to the PhD program at Tsinghua Univ., I studied in the Quantitative Biosciences PhD program at Georgia Tech remotely for a year until I had a visa issue. I was then co-advised by Prof. Hannah Choi (Gatech), Prof. Xiaoxuan Jia (Tsinghua Univ.), and Prof. Joel Zylberberg (York Univ.) on the project of stimulus-dependent functional networks. 

Research interests
======
Currently at Neural Coding Lab led by Prof. Xiaoxuan Jia, I'm interested in
* encoding the visual information as dynamic networks of neurons;
* controlling the brain network;
* brain-inspired AI.
